    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Rice is the grain that feeds the world. Here's how to cook it perfectly every time.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>rice</li>
            <li>water</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>To wash away excess starch, measure rice into a pot and pour in enough cold water to cover the grains. Gently swish the rice with your fingers and rub lightly. Pour out the starchy water (you can pour through a sieve so you don't lose any grains). Repeat one or two times, depending on how starchy the rice is. The water does not have to be completely clear after the final wash.</li>
            <li>After pouring out the water for the last time, add clean water to the pot </li>
            <li>Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let the rice gently simmer for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice continue to steam in the covered pot for five minutes.</li>
        </ol>
